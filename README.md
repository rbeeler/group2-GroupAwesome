# group2-GroupAwesome
This is the repo for our AD320 group project 1. Our group includes Shihpei Ling, Maria Kalusz, Thomas Oducayen, and Ruth Beeler.

For our project, we decided to create a site that is for movie lovers. We were thinking it would be similar to goodreads; users could have their own profile, reviews, and friends. Essentially, it would be place for movie lovers to discuss and learn about movies in a place that is welcoming, accessible, and fun.
